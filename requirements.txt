# CRITICAL: Use headless version for Streamlit Cloud (no GUI dependencies like libGL.so.1)
# If opencv-python is installed, it will cause "libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file" error
# Note: opencv-python-headless and opencv-python cannot coexist - headless must be used
# Install headless first, then explicitly exclude regular opencv-python
